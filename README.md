# testing_purpose

Just some simple testing.

My name is Matthijs van der Plas, 35 years of age and from the Netherlands. I am always wanted to be a programmer (Software Engineer/Developer). Had a shaky past and never managed to finish much of my schooling, but now I am here to start a new. I have been active on Udemy learning Python as a start. Hope to be doing much, much more soon.

Have a nice day,

Matthijs van der Plas
